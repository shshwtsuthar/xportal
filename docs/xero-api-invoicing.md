GET Invoices
Use this method to retrieve one or many invoices.

By default responses are formatted as XML. You can also retrieve responses in JSON format.
When you retrieve multiple invoices, only a summary of the contact is returned and no line details are returned – this is to keep the response more compact.
The line item details will be returned when you retrieve an individual invoice, either by specifying Invoice ID, Invoice Number, querying by Statuses or by using the optional paging parameter (below).
When you retrieve invoices by querying by Statuses, pagination is enforced by default.
Individual invoices (e.g. Invoices/97c2dc5-cc47-4afd-8ec8-74990b8761e9) can also be returned as PDF's see our HTTP GET documentation

Optional parameters for GET Invoices
Field	Description
Record filter	You can specify an individual record by appending the value to the endpoint, i.e. GET https://.../Invoices/{identifier}
InvoiceID - The Xero identifier for an Invoice
e.g. 297c2dc5-cc47-4afd-8ec8-74990b8761e9
InvoiceNumber - The InvoiceNumber
e.g. INV-01514
Modified After	The ModifiedAfter filter is actually an HTTP header: ' If-Modified-Since'.
A UTC timestamp (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss) . Only invoices created or modified since this timestamp will be returned e.g. 2009-11-12T00:00:00
IDs, InvoiceNumbers, ContactIDs, Statuses	Filter by a comma-separated list of InvoicesIDs, InvoiceNumbers, ContactIDs or Statuses. See details.
Where	Filter using the where parameter. We recommend you limit filtering to the optimised elements only.
createdByMyApp	When set to true you'll only retrieve Invoices created by your app
order	Order by any element returned ( see Order By )
page	100 invoices will be returned per call as the default when the page parameter is used by itself e.g. page=1
pageSize	Used with the page parameter. Sets the # of invoices to be returned per call when the pageSize parameter is used with the page parameter e.g. page=1&pageSize=250.
summaryOnly	When set to true, this returns lightweight fields, excluding computation-heavy fields from the response, making the API calls quick and efficient.
SearchTerm	Search parameter that performs a case-insensitive text search across the fields: InvoiceNumber, Reference.
Example: GET https://.../Invoices?SearchTerm="REF12"
High volume threshold limit
In order to make our platform more stable, we've added a high volume threshold limit for the GET Invoices Endpoint.

Requests that have more than 100k invoices being returned in the response will be denied and receive a 400 response code
Requests using unoptimised fields for filtering or ordering that result in more than 100k invoices will be denied with a 400 response code
Please continue reading to find out how you can use paging and optimise your filtering to ensure your requests are always successful. Be sure to check out the Efficient Data Retrieval page for tips on query optimisation.

Paging invoices (recommended)
By using paging all the line item details for each invoice are returned which may avoid the need to retrieve each individual invoice.

More information about retrieving paged resources.

Optimised use of the where filter
The most common filters have been optimised to ensure performance across organisations of all sizes. We recommend you restrict your filtering to the following optimised parameters.

Range Operators in Where clauses
Indicated fields also support the range operators: greater than, greater than or equals, less than, less than or equals (>, >=, <, <=).

Range operators can be combined with the AND operator to query a date or numerical range. eg where=Date>=DateTime(2020, 01, 01) AND Date<DateTime(2020, 02, 01), where=AmountDue>=5000 AND AmountDue<6000

When using individually or combined with the AND operator:

Field	Operator	Query
Status	equals	where=Status="AUTHORISED"
Contact.ContactID	equals	where=Contact.ContactID=guid("96988e67-ecf9-466d-bfbf-0afa1725a649")
Contact.Name	equals	where=Contact.Name="ABC limited"
Contact.ContactNumber	equals	where=Contact.ContactNumber="ID001"
Reference	equals	where=Reference="REF12"
InvoiceNumber	equals	where=InvoiceNumber="INV-001"
InvoiceId	equals	where=InvoiceId=guid("220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734")
Date	equals, range	where=Date=DateTime(2020, 01, 01)
where=Date>DateTime(2020, 01, 01)
Type	equals	where=Type="ACCREC"
AmountDue	equals, range	where=AmountDue=1000
where=AmountDue<=5
AmountPaid	equals	where=AmountPaid=1000
DueDate	equals, range	where=DueDate=DateTime(2023,11,25)
where=Date<DateTime(2024, 01, 01)
Example: Retrieve all ACCPAY Invoices (bills) with an AUTHORISED status

?where=Type=="ACCPAY" AND Status=="AUTHORISED"

copy code
This would translate to the following URL once encoded.

https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/invoices?where=Type%3d%3d%22ACCPAY%22+AND+Status%3d%3d%22AUTHORISED%22

copy code
When using with the OR operator:

Field	Operator	Query
InvoiceId	equals	where=InvoiceId=guid("220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734") or InvoiceId=guid("88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0")
Although where=InvoiceId=guid("220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734") or InvoiceId=guid("88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0") and ?IDs=220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734,88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0 are functionally equivalent, using ?IDs= can reduce the size of the request. Additionally, the optimisation of the or operator is restricted to InvoiceId field only. Using or with other fields is not optimised and may lead to exceeding the threshold limit.

For optimal performance when querying multiple values for a field, please refer to the next section.

Optimised filtering on a list of values
The following query parameters allow you to filter on a comma separated list of values:

Field	Query Parameter
Statuses	?Statuses=AUTHORISED,DRAFT
IDs	?IDs=220ddca8-3144-4085-9a88-2d72c5133734,88192a99-cbc5-4a66-bf1a-2f9fea2d36d0
InvoiceNumbers	?InvoiceNumbers=INV-001,INV-002,INV-003
ContactIDs	?ContactIDs=3138017f-8ddc-420e-a159-e7e1cf9e643d,4b2df4a1-7aa5-4ce3-9e9c-3c55794c5283
Example: Retrieve all AUTHORISED and PAID Invoices belonging to two specific contacts

https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/invoices?Statuses=AUTHORISED,PAID&ContactIDs=3138017f-8ddc-420e-a159-e7e1cf9e643d,4b2df4a1-7aa5-4ce3-9e9c-3c55794c5283

copy code
Optimised ordering:
The following parameters are optimised for ordering:

InvoiceId
UpdatedDateUTC
Date
The default order is UpdatedDateUTC ASC, InvoiceId ASC. Secondary ordering is applied by default using the InvoiceId. This ensures consistency across pages.

Retrieving a smaller lightweight response using the summaryOnly parameter
Use summaryOnly=true in GET Invoices endpoint to retrieve a smaller version of the response object. This returns only lightweight fields, excluding computation-heavy fields from the response, making the API calls quick and efficient. The following fields will be excluded from the response:

Payments
HasAttachments
LineItems
CISDeduction
https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/invoices?summaryOnly=True

copy code
The summaryOnly parameter works with other filters, but not when filtering on the excluded fields. And when this parameter is used, pagination is enforced by default.

Retrieving the online invoice url
To integrate your application with Xero's online invoicing, you can retrieve the online invoice url for sales (ACCREC) invoices. Note: you cannot retrieve an online invoice url for DRAFT invoices.

Example for retrieving an online invoice url

GET https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/9b9ba9e5-e907-4b4e-8210-54d82b0aa479/OnlineInvoice

POST Invoices
Use this method to create or update an invoice

Note: Be sure to check Organisation Actions to verify you can create invoices for the user.

The following are required to create a draft invoice

Field	Description
Type	See Invoice Types
Contact	See Contacts
LineItems	See LineItems. The LineItems collection can contain any number of individual LineItem sub-elements. At least one is required to create a complete Invoice.
The following are optional when creating or updating invoices

Field	Description
Date	Date invoice was issued – YYYY-MM-DD. If the Date element is not specified it will default to the current date based on the timezone setting of the organisation
DueDate	Date invoice is due – YYYY-MM-DD
LineAmountTypes	Line amounts are exclusive of tax by default if you don't specify this element. See Line Amount Types
InvoiceNumber	ACCREC – Unique alpha numeric code identifying invoice ( when missing will auto-generate from your Organisation Invoice Settings) (max length = 255)
ACCPAY – non-unique alpha numeric code identifying invoice. This value will also display as Reference in the UI. (max length = 255)
Reference	ACCREC only – additional reference number (max length = 255)
BrandingThemeID	See BrandingThemes
Url	URL link to a source document – shown as "Go to [appName]" in the Xero app
CurrencyCode	The currency that invoice has been raised in (see Currencies)
CurrencyRate	The currency rate for a multicurrency invoice. If no rate is specified, the XE.com day rate is used. (max length = [18].[6])
Status	See Invoice Status Codes
SentToContact	Boolean to set whether the invoice in the Xero app should be marked as "sent". This can be set only on invoices that have been approved
ExpectedPaymentDate	Shown on sales invoices (Accounts Receivable) when this has been set
PlannedPaymentDate	Shown on bills (Accounts Payable) when this has been set
Elements for LineItems

Field	Description
Description	Description needs to be at least 1 char long. A line item with just a description (i.e no unit amount or quantity) can be created by specifying just a Description element that contains at least 1 character (max length = 4000)
Quantity	LineItem Quantity (max length = 13)
UnitAmount	Lineitem unit amount. By default, unit amount will be rounded to two decimal places. You can opt in to use four decimal places by adding the querystring parameter unitdp=4 to your query. See the Rounding in Xero guide for more information.
ItemCode	See Items
AccountCode	See Accounts
LineItemID	The Xero generated identifier for a LineItem. It is recommended that you include LineItemIDs on update requests. If LineItemIDs are not included with line items in an update request then the line items are deleted and recreated.
TaxType	Used as an override if the default Tax Code for the selected AccountCode is not correct – see TaxTypes.
TaxAmount	The tax amount is auto calculated as a percentage of the line amount (see below) based on the tax rate. This value can be overriden if the calculated TaxAmount is not correct.
LineAmount	The line amount reflects the discounted price if a DiscountRate has been used i.e LineAmount = Quantity * Unit Amount * ((100 – DiscountRate)/100) (can't exceed 9,999,999,999.99 )
DiscountRate or DiscountAmount	Percentage discount or discount amount being applied to a line item. Only supported on ACCREC invoices and quotes. ACCPAY invoices and credit notes in Xero do not support discounts
Tracking	Section for optional Tracking Category – see TrackingCategory. Any LineItem can have a maximum of 2 TrackingCategory elements.
Elements for TrackingCategory

Field	Description
Name	Name of the tracking category (required)
Option	Name of the option (required)
Creating, updating and deleting line items when updating invoices
In an update (POST) request:

Providing an existing LineItem with its LineItemID will update that line item.
Providing a LineItem with no LineItemID will create a new line item.
Not providing an existing LineItem with it's LineItemID will result in that line item being deleted.
Addresses on Invoices
By default, the address applied to an invoice will use the postal (POBOX) address of the Contact. However, This can be changed in Xero by applying a custom invoice template. It is not possible to manually override the address on a per-invoice basis.

Invoice Status Codes
When creating new invoices or modifying existing invoices you can optionally specify a "Status" element. New invoices can have either one of the following three status codes :

Field	Description
Status	Description
DRAFT	- The default status if this element is not provided with your API call
- Can contain incomplete line items (e.g. missing account codes)
- No journals are created so the details will not be used in any reports
SUBMITTED	- Useful if there is an approval process required
- No journals are created so the details will not be used in any reports
AUTHORISED	- The "approved" state of an invoice ready for sending to a customer
- Journals are created in Xero so all details will be used in reports
- You can now apply payments to the invoice
- Once an invoice is fully paid invoice the status will change to PAID
Invoice status changes
The following state changes are valid when updating invoices.

Existing status	New status
DRAFT	DRAFT
DRAFT	SUBMITTED
DRAFT	AUTHORISED
DRAFT	DELETED
SUBMITTED	SUBMITTED
SUBMITTED	AUTHORISED
SUBMITTED	DRAFT
SUBMITTED	DELETED
AUTHORISED	AUTHORISED
AUTHORISED	VOIDED
Updating Invoices
You can only update an invoice depending on the type of invoice, and its payment status.

ACCREC	ACCPAY
Unpaid	Yes	Yes
Paid (in part, or in full)	Yes – with exceptions below	No
In a locked period	No	No
If an invoice is paid in part or in full, you can only update the following fields:

Reference
DueDate
InvoiceNumber
BrandingThemeID
Contact, unless the payment is made with a Credit Note
URL
LineItems
Description
AccountCode, except for Construction Industry Scheme (CIS) account codes
Tracking
Creating a PAID Invoice
Creating a PAID invoice is a two step process:

First an AUTHORISED invoice needs to be made using the Invoices endpoint.
Second a payment for the outstanding amount needs to be applied using the payments endpoint.
Once the invoice has been fully paid the system will move it to the PAID status.

Deleting and Voiding Invoices
You can delete a DRAFT or SUBMITTED invoice by updating the Status to DELETED.

If an invoice has been AUTHORISED it cannot be deleted but you can set it's status to VOIDED

If you send invoices from your app you can mark them as sent in Xero by setting SentToContact as true

SummarizeErrors
If you are entering many invoices in a single API call then we recommend you utilise our response format that shows validation errors for each invoice. Each Invoice will be returned with a status element that contains the value OK or ERROR. If an invoice has a error then one or more validation errors will be returned.

Example of the altered response format using the SummarizeErrors=false parameter

POST https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices?SummarizeErrors=false

Uploading an Attachment
You can upload up to 10 attachments (each up to 25mb in size) per invoice, once the invoice has been created in Xero. To do this you'll need to know the ID of the invoice which you'll use to construct the URL when POST/PUTing a byte stream containing the attachment file. e.g. https://api.xero.com/api.xro/2.0/Invoices/ f0ec0d8c-6fce-4330-bb3b-8306278c6fd8/Attachments/ image.png. See the Attachments page for more details.

Emailing an invoice
You can use the API to trigger the email of a sales invoice out of Xero. The invoice must be of Type ACCREC and a valid Status for sending (SUBMITTED,AUTHORISED or PAID).

The email will be sent to the primary email address of the contact on the invoice and any additional contact persons that have IncludeInEmails flag set to true. The sender will be the user who authorised the app connection.

The subject and body of the email will generated from the organisation’s default template. You can read more about email templates here.

There is a daily limit per Xero organisation for sending invoices. This includes emails sent via the app and the API:

1,000 per day for paying organisations
20 per day for trial organisations
0 per day for demo organisations
We recommend that you monitor the number of emails sent per organisation to avoid hitting these limits. Xero monitors the emails it sends to detect potential spam and protect our email reputation. It's important to us that our customers’ email gets through. If your application receives a 400 rate limit error prior to exceeding the email limits above this is a result of the organisation being restricted due to suspicious activity. We suggest you either try again later or direct the customer to make contact with Xero Support.

Please note: The response code returned for a successful request is a 204 (no content). Bad requests, including rate limit hits, will be returned as a 400 (e.g. if the invoice is an invalid status); this includes trying to send invoice emails from organisations who are not allowed to send emails, such as those on Xero’s Partner Edition Plans.

An example request to trigger an email

PUT Invoices
The PUT method is similar to the POST Invoices method, however you can only create new invoices with this method.

Webhooks
You can create a subscription to get invoice events. Create and update events are available (incuding when invoices are archived). See the Webhooks page for more details.

Retrieving History
View a summary of the actions made by all users to the invoice. See the History and Notes page for more details.

Example of retrieving a invoice's history
