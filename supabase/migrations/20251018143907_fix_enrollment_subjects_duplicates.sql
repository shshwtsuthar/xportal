-- Fix Enrollment Subject Duplicates Migration
-- This migration addresses the bug where prerequisite subjects appear twice in enrollment_subjects
-- due to incorrect logic in the freeze_application_learning_plan function.

-- Step 1: Clean up existing duplicate records
-- Remove duplicate enrollment_subjects records, keeping the one with the larger id (original)
DELETE FROM public.enrollment_subjects
WHERE id NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT ON (enrollment_id, program_plan_subject_id) id
  FROM public.enrollment_subjects
  ORDER BY enrollment_id, program_plan_subject_id, id DESC
);

-- Step 2: Add unique constraint to prevent future duplicates
ALTER TABLE public.enrollment_subjects 
ADD CONSTRAINT enrollment_subjects_enrollment_subject_unique 
UNIQUE (enrollment_id, program_plan_subject_id);

-- Step 3: Fix the freeze_application_learning_plan function
-- The bug was in the prerequisite handling logic where prerequisites were being inserted twice:
-- 1. Once as aligned prerequisites (correct)
-- 2. Again in the current cycle subjects (incorrect - should exclude prerequisites)
